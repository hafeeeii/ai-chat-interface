## 1. Research

### Platforms Reviewed & Chosen Features

I reviewed three major AI interfaces to identify compelling design patterns and user experience principles:

#### a. Hugging Face Spaces  
Hugging Face Spaces is a directory of AI-powered applications hosted by the community. While it does not provide a single unified interface, many individual Spaces (such as HuggingChat) feature **chat-style interactions** with message alignment, parameter controls, and dark mode. The platform emphasizes **discoverability** through curated categories and trending apps, making it easy for users to explore diverse AI capabilities.

#### b. Anthropic Claude UI  
Anthropic Claude offers a clean, focused chat interface with a **collapsible sidebar** for navigation and chat history. It includes a **model selector** (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4), **persistent conversations**, and **personalized greetings**. The layout prioritizes clarity and workflow, with a minimalist design that reduces cognitive load.

#### c. Microsoft Copilot Lab  
Microsoft Copilot Lab provides a **sidebar-based interface** with access to past conversations and quick-start templates. The main area includes a **prompt input** with **quick-response buttons** (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite a first draft‚Äù, ‚ÄúDesign a logo‚Äù) and a **dark theme**. This approach encourages productivity by offering immediate guidance and reducing typing effort.

### Chosen Features (6)

Based on research, I implemented the following features:

1. **Model Selector** ‚Äì Dropdown to choose between GPT models  
2. **Prompt Editor** ‚Äì Text area with save/load template functionality  
3. **Parameters Panel** ‚Äì Controls for temperature and max tokens  
4. **Chat Output Area** ‚Äì Displays conversation with copy/download actions  
5. **Theme Toggle** ‚Äì Light/dark mode with system preference detection  
6. **Responsive Layout** ‚Äì Mobile-first design with collapsible sidebar  

These features balance simplicity and control, enabling both casual and advanced users.

## 2. Design

### Figma Mockup

üîó [Figma mockup link](https://www.figma.com/design/PrsKyrFZ2NSvg2ftBr4VdG/ai-chat-interface?node-id=0-1&t=yTQ8zliujvombmUw-1)  



###  Code Implementation Notes

- **Model Selector**: Implemented with `DropdownMenu` from shadcn/ui.
- **Prompt Editor**: Uses `Textarea` with save/load buttons; templates are stored in component state.
- **Parameters Panel**: `Slider` for temperature, `Input` for max tokens etc.
- **Theme Toggle**: Uses `Toggle` component with `useTheme()` hook; persists preference via `localStorage`.
- **Copy/Download**: Buttons trigger clipboard write and JSON download of chat history.

All components follow shadcn/ui patterns for consistency and accessibility.
